# Longview Farm HOA - Lee's Summit, MO
The documents in this repository include the Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs) for the Longview Farm Homeowner Association.

 - The file named "Amendments.txt" contains the "current" version of our CC&Rs.
 - The file named "Articles IX-XI.txt" contains the heart of the CC&Rs and the rules that are of most interest to current homeowners.
 
 If you view the history of each document, you can see the changes that were introduced with each amendment to the CC&Rs.
 
 The earliest document I have, and the basis for this repository, is the Second Amendment.  The most recent amendment was the Ninth Amendment.
